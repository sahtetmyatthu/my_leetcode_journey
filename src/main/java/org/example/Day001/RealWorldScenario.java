 *Real-World Example: Buying Items in a Store ðŸ›’

 * Imagine youâ€™re at a store, and you have $50 to spend. You want to buy exactly two items that add up to $50.
 * The store has these items:
 * 	1.	Shoes - $20
 * 	2.	Bag - $30
 * 	3.	Watch - $40
 * 	4.	Sunglasses - $10
 * You need to find which two items you can buy so that the total is $50.
 * How do you solve it?
 * 	â€¢	You check each item one by one and see if thereâ€™s another item that completes your budget.
 * 	â€¢	Shoes ($20) + Bag ($30) = $50 âœ…
 * 	â€¢	So, you pick Shoes and Bag!
